I. Introduction/Basic Gameplay

Basically, I am writing this FAQ because there in no FAQ
for Battleship for NES currently at GameFAQs.com.  I went to
check an FAQ for this game to find out what the sonar does, 
and I found no info.  So instead, I decided to write my own 
FAQ about the game.  

Milton Bradley (huh, I thought he played baseball?) first 
released this board game back in the '70s, and the NES 
version was released in 1993.  I’ve only been playing it for a 
couple weeks, but it has become one of my favorite NES
games. 

As you can tell by the name, this game is based on the classic
board game Battleship, and this game goes on the same premise 
of the board game.  There are a few differences, which will be
mentioned later in the walkthrough.

I thoroughly enjoyed this game, though it does get quite 
repetitive.  If you are a big fan of the board game Battleship
(which I am), they you will like this game as well.

Just remember that this game involves a lot of luck.  You can
go on big winning streaks and losing streaks.  You will get 
frustrated, but don’t give up, because this is a very fun game.

I've written, check out:

II. Controls

The NES controller is very simple, making the controls very 
simple as well.

SETTING PIECES:

Control Pad = Move ship up, down, left, or right
A = Select Location for Ship
B = Flip Ship

ATTACKING:

Control Pad = Move crosshairs up, down, left, or right
A = Select location to attack
B = Select location to attack
SELECT = Chose weapon to attack with
START = View your own board

==============================================================

IV. The Game


A. Basics
The game starts up right away.  Choose start, and you will
enter BATTLE 1-1.  Now you have to choose where to place all of
your ships.  I like to place them randomly across the board.

It is not a good idea to place them all in one location, because
the special weapons will hit them many times if they are located
together.

After your pieces are set, its time to attack.  Switch through
your weapons, and attack with one you like.  It is good to use
all of the special weapons first, because if any boat is sunk, 
you lose that weapon.  Remember that you can use each special
weapon only once, and you will be down to the RIM-66 (regular
single shot) after they are gone.

On your screen, you will notice a box in the corner.  It keeps 
track of the number of your shots, your hits, your accuracy, and 
the amount of remaining squares your ship has.

Keep in mind that there are 96 total boxes, so you’re total
number of shots should be under 96, unless you have shot the
same place several times.

Once you fire, it will cut to a movie scene where your missile
either hits the ship or misses it. NOTE: The location of the 
missile hitting the water is random, and does not represent the
real location of the ship.  For example, if you miss on the bottom
left of the ship, that does not mean that the ship is really up
and right.

After firing, your screen will either have a red or blue dot on it
Red is hit, and blue is miss.  Once you hit a ship, continue firing
in that area until it has been sunk.  You will be notified if a 
ship has been finished off in the cut scene.  They cannot go diagonal.

Shots are exchanged back and forth until somebody has lost all of
their ships.  If you win, you will be given a password, and move
on to the next level.  If you lose, you will be given the option
of looking at the computers screen, and retrying the level.


B. LEVEL 1
I noticed no change in the computers talent between levels 
1-1 and 1-5.  You just have to beat the computer 5 times, which
is rather simple to do.  Just use all of your special weapons
before you lose them.

Passwords:
1-1  None
1-2  9946
1-3  8472
1-4  5535
1-5  1929


C. LEVEL 2
Very little change in the AI of the game, just 5 more easy levels.
The one difference is that starting in 2-1, there is a new ship,
the submarine.  It comes with its own special weapon, and takes up
only one space.  It can be very hard to find on the computers screen.
Also, always fire with the submarine's special weapon first, because 
after one turn, it could be destroyed and gone.

Passwords:
2-1  7390
2-2  6501
2-3  5340
2-4  1536
2-5  3328 


D. LEVEL 3
Again, the computer plays stupid, and is easily beatable.  The 
change that starts in Level 3 is that the Destroyer is now equipped
with another special weapon, a sonar.  It surfaces over 8 squares
and the waves and sound becomes longer if it finds the submarine.
Save the sonar until later in the level or until your Destroyer is 
almost sunk, because you will probably need it to help find the 
submarine at the end.  Also, 3-1 is the first level where I noticed 
that the computer placed ships that were touching each other, though
this might be a coincidence.

Passwords:
3-1  9537
3-2  8777
3-3  2037
3-4  5289
3-5  3500


E. LEVEL 4
The cruiser now caries a nice little aerial recon.  It is just a 
square, with 4 total squares in its area.  But it can be used for
finding any ship, including the submarine. It reacts the same way as
the sonar.  The difficulty starts to increase noticeably, or I'm
just getting worse.

Passwords:
4-1  3500
4-2  3642
4-3  4412
4-4  8379
4-5  8182


F. LEVEL 5
No noticeable changes in the gameplay, just in the difficulty, 
which is increasing.  The computer has touching ships often now.  
In fact, in Battle 5-4, all the ships were placed on the left 
half of the screen in my game.

Passwords:
5-1  8004
5-2  5529
5-3  4524
5-4  4797
5-5  9376


G. LEVEL 6
The insanely huge Carrier appears in this level.  Since almost 1/4 
of the squares are occupied now, there will be a lot more action.
And the Carrier's special weapon is sweet.  The best way to win
is to get all of your special shots off, and try to stop the computer
from shooting all of his.

Passwords:
6-1  1553
6-2  7850
6-3  5669
6-4  9381
6-5  9374


H. LEVEL 7
You will notice the new Harpoon 55M in this level, it is equipped 
to the battleship.  Though the creators may have thought that all
these weapons would increase the challenge of the game, it has
really decreased the difficulty.  The computer's AI is better,
though.  

Passwords:
7-1  4653
7-2  5012
7-3  8831
7-4  9457
7-5  6098


I. LEVEL 8
The cruiser obtains yet another huge weapon.  Again, the goal is to
fire all of your special weapons, and not lose any to sunken ships.
Here is a weird fact, I have never once hit a ship with the L shaped
weapon.  Also, my last game was also my best, with a 46% accuracy
rate.

Password:
8-1  9617
8-2  5036
8-3  6297
8-4  8629
8-5  8397


J. The Ending

The ending is just a battleship with crappy fireworks being fired
out of it.  To see the ending, enter the password 1992.  From there,
push start to see the credits.

==================================================================

V. Strategies

There are just a couple strategies I noticed on this game:

1. If you fire all your special weapons, you will probably win.

2. Check the corners, because the CPU very often puts ships there.
 
3. If you only need to destroy one more ship, attack only in places 
   it could be located.  For example, if you need to destroy the
   Battleship (5 spaces), then only fire shots in areas that the
   Battleship would fit.  Very simple.

4. Spread your shots out.  By the end of the game, you can use all
   of your special weapons to basically pan over the entire screen.

==================================================================

VI. Differences Between NES Game and Board Game

Besides the obvious difference that you use a controller instead
or little pegs to attack, there are a couple other differences.

1. The board game has 5 ships. The Carrier takes 5 spaces, 
   Battleship takes up 4 spaces, Cruiser takes 3 spaces, Submarine 
   takes 3 spaces, and Destroyer takes 2 spaces.
   The NES game has 6 ships. The Carrier takes 8 spaces, 
   Battleship takes 5 spaces, Cruiser takes 4 Spaces, Destroyer 
   takes 3 spaces, Frigate takes 2 spaces, and the Submarine takes
   just 1 space.
   Thanks to Jed C. for correcting me on this one.

2. The Frigate does not exist in the board game.

3. Special Weapons do not exist in the board game.

4. Cool animations do not exist in the board game.
